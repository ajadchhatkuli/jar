The atomic action 'Mechanic use high-pressure water jet at 05:35' directly and unambiguously satisfies the sub_step 'Mechanic rinses exterior', as a high-pressure water jet is commonly used for rinsing during a car wash, especially after multiple washing actions. All sub_steps for step 25 are clearly and unambiguously satisfied by these recent actions, which logically follow the underbody wash (Step 24, confirmed at 05:25).",
